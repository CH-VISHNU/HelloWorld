Thiruppavai
Her first work is the Thiruppavai, a collection of 30 verses in which Andal imagines herself to be a gopi, one of the cowherd girls known for their unconditional devotion to Krishna. In Thiruppavai, Andal idolized Radha as the ideal gopi and also invoked the gopis of Braj.[13] Nappinai is identified as a form of Lakshmi, who is accorded the status of the supreme consort of Vishnu in Sri Vaishnavism.[14] In these verses, she describes the yearning to serve Vishnu and achieve happiness not just in one lifetime, but for all eternity. She also describes the religious vows (pavai) that she and her fellow cowherd girls will observe for this purpose. It is said that Thiruppavai is the nectar of Vedas and teaches philosophical values, moral values, ethical values, pure love, devotion, dedication, single-minded aim, virtues, and the ultimate goal of life.[15][16]

Andal extols Krishna thus in this text:[17]

மரயனைமன்னு வடமதுரைலமந்தனை

தூயபெருநீர்‌ யமுனைத்துறைவனை ஆயர்குலத்தினில்‌ தோன்றும்‌ ௮அணிவிளக்மை தாயைக்குடல்‌ விளக்கம்‌ செய்த தாமோதரனை தூயோமாய்வந்துநாம்‌ தூமலர்‌ தூவித்தொழுது வாயினால்பாடி மனத்தினால்‌ சித்திக்க ோயபிழையும்‌ புகுதருவான்‌ நின்றனவும்‌ தியினில்தூசாகும்‌ செப்பேலோரெம்பாவாய்‌

My dear girls! you all know the Mayan, (Sri Krishna the Mysterious, whose greatness is beyond description and whose actions are beyond common understanding), who was born in North Matra and who sports in the large waters of the Pure Jumna, who shines like a Ratna Deepa (Emerald lamp) among the cowherd folk, the Damodara who brought name and fame to His mother Yasoda! We shall approach Him in all purity, We shall strew pure and choice flowers at His feet and worship Him. We shall sing about Him and we shall (unceasingly) think of Him: and thereby shall our sins, those already committed and those we are likely to commit in the future, all of them disappear like cotton in fire.
